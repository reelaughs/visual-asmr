Ideas for next version/iteration:

1) Audio audio audio! could use a lot of work I know
- Audio-visual integration and interactions
- Add more pre-made tracks to the library instead of just synth sounds, eg from public domain libraries, CCO music.

2) Export a “share” link with the selected parameters in the URL. eg preset sharer (URL parameters) so that anyone can link directly to a look + sound combo.

3) Greater customization: Eg add a red large circle next to a yellow small circle as a precise palette/composition builder, eg add a small “+ Add shape” palette with colour/size/type pickers and editable list
